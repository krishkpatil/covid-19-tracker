## Introduction

The COVID-19 Tracker is a web application designed to provide real-time updates on the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging the power of React, the application fetches and displays global and country-specific data, including the number of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. The data is sourced from the reliable [DiseaseAPI](https://github.com/disease-sh/api), ensuring up-to-date and accurate information.

This project was created with a focus on responsiveness and usability. The interface is built using React, enhanced with Material UI for a clean and modern look, and Charts.js for dynamic data visualization. This combination ensures the tracker is accessible and visually engaging across devices, providing users with a seamless experience whether they are on a desktop or mobile device.
